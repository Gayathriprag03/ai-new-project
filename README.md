# 🧠🎨 Painting with AI

**Painting with AI** is an artificial intelligence project that explores how machines can generate creative artworks based on user prompts, emotions, and visual concepts.  
This project was developed as part of the **Building AI course** by **Reaktor** and **the University of Helsinki**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to show how AI can be used to create digital paintings and artistic styles automatically.  
It combines **machine learning**, **image generation**, and **style transfer** techniques to produce paintings inspired by classical artists and modern abstract art.

The project demonstrates that artificial intelligence can be more than just logical—it can also be **creative**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use AI to generate artistic images based on text prompts or sample inputs  
- Experiment with neural networks trained on different painting styles  
- Encourage creative collaboration between humans and AI  
- Showcase how AI models like **Deep Dream** or **Stable Diffusion** can produce unique visuals

## ⚙️ Technologies and Tools

- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
- **Deep Learning models (VGG19, Stable Diffusion, or similar)**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Colab**
- **Matplotlib / OpenCV**
- **NumPy / Pillow**

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Input:**  
   The user provides a text prompt (e.g., *"sunset over mountains in Van Gogh style"*) or uploads an image.  
2. **AI Model:**  
   The model processes the input using a **neural style transfer** or **text-to-image** generator.  
3. **Output:**  
   The AI produces a **painting-like image** combining artistic style with the content input.  
4. **User Review:**  
   The user can download or further refine the generated artwork.

## 🖼️ Example Outputs

| Input Prompt | AI-Generated Painting |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| *“A peaceful lake at sunrise”* | 🌅 Lake painting with soft warm tones |
| *“City skyline in Van Gogh style”* | 🌃 Swirling city lights in brushstroke style |
| *“Abstract emotion of joy”* | 💫 Vibrant color splash pattern |
